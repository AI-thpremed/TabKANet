## Motivation

**We introduce TabKANet, a novel model that leverages a KAN-based Numerical Embedding Module and Transformer to overcome neural networks' limitations in tabular data.**

## Dataset





## Usage

Detailed examples demonstrating the usage of our models can be found in the [template](templates/) directory.



## Conclusion

We present an end-to-end, PyTorch-based Transformer framework specifically designed for tabular data. Accompanied by pre-integrated templates and functions, our framework aims to streamline your workflows without sacrificing flexibility. We believe it will prove to be a valuable asset for your data modeling tasks.
